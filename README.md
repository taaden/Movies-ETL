# Movies-ETL
## The purpose of the project was to create an automated ETL pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate
    transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
 
 * The refactor code was used to create one function that takes in the three filesâ€”Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data
 * The ETL process was performed by extracting and transforming the Wikipedia Data and the Kaggle data.
 * And subsequently by merging the data before adding it to a PostgreSQL database.
 ### Results
     The ETL process resulted in a constistent, less null riden data that can be use for analysis
